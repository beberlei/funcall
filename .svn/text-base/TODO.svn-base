Enhancements
 * add callbacks in php.ini
 * function replacement

ideas from lach AT php5.pl:
* passing function parameters by reference to 
  pre-call function, so that they can be changed
* allowing to stop executing of the hook chain
  by, for example, returning bool(false) from one
  of pre-call function
* additional parameter passed to pre-call function
  (by reference) allowing to set return value for
  function
